# Security Policy

This document defines security reporting and handling for the Polly project.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

To privately report a security vulnerability in Polly, please create a security advisory in this [repository's Security tab][report-vulnerability].

1. Navigate to the [Security tab][security] tab of this repository.
2. Click on [Advisories][report-vulnerability] in the left sidebar.
3. Click on the green **Report a vulnerability** button and follow the prompts and instructions. Please provide as much detail as possible.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Please do not open public GitHub issues, pull requests or discussions for anything you think might have a security implication.

Please allow **up to 7 days** for an initial response from a maintainer. If you do not receive a response within that
time, please follow up by commenting on the advisory. You can also reach out to the maintainers via a Direct Message in the [Polly Slack Community][slack].

A maintainer may respond in a shorter time frame that stated above, but the maintainers may not be in your time zone, be
on holiday/vacation, or otherwise unavailable, so please be patient. We take any vulnerability reports we receive seriously.

> [!TIP]
> Further details on how to privately report a vulnerability using GitHub can be found in the [GitHub documentation][privately-reporting].

## Incident Response Process

> [!NOTE]
