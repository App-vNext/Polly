# Contributing

Please be sure to branch from the head of the default branch when developing contributions.

For GitHub workflow, check out our [Wiki](https://github.com/App-vNext/Polly/wiki/Git-Workflow).

Since Polly is part of the .NET Foundation, we ask our contributors to abide by their [Code of Conduct](https://www.dotnetfoundation.org/code-of-conduct).  To contribute (beyond trivial typo corrections), review and sign the [.NET Foundation Contributor License Agreement](https://cla.dotnetfoundation.org/). This ensures the community is free to use your contributions.  The registration process can be completed entirely online.

Also, we've stood up a [Slack](http://www.pollytalk.org) channel for easier real-time discussion of ideas and the general direction of Polly as a whole. Be sure to [join the conversation](http://www.pollytalk.org) today!.
