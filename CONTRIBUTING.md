# Contributing

Please be sure to branch from the head of the default branch when developing contributions.

For our GitHub workflow, check out our [documentation](https://www.pollydocs.org/community/git-workflow.html).

Since Polly is part of the .NET Foundation, we ask our contributors to abide by their [Code of Conduct](https://www.dotnetfoundation.org/code-of-conduct). To contribute (beyond trivial typo corrections), review and sign the [.NET Foundation Contributor License Agreement](https://cla.dotnetfoundation.org/). This ensures the community is free to use your contributions.  The registration process can be completed entirely online.

Also, we've stood up a [Slack][slack] channel for easier real-time discussion of ideas and the general direction of Polly as a whole. Be sure to [join the conversation][slack] today!.
