     - Add a new onBreak overload that provides the prior state on a transition to an open state
     - Bug fix: RelativeTtl in CachePolicy now always returns a ttl relative to time item is cached
            
     5.7.0
     ---------------------
     - Minor cache fixes
     - Add ability to calculate cache Ttl based on item to cache

     - Bug fix: Sync TimeoutPolicy in pessimistic mode no longer interposes AggregateException.
     - Provide public factory methods for PolicyResult, to support testing.
     - Fallback delegates can now take handled fault as input parameter.

     5.3.1
     ---------------------
     - Make ISyncPolicy&lt;TResult&gt; public
     - (Upgrade solution to msbuild15)

     5.3.0
     ---------------------
     - Fix ExecuteAndCapture() usage with PolicyWrap   
     - Allow Fallback delegates to take execution Context
     - Provide IReadOnlyPolicyRegistry interface

     5.2.0
     ---------------------
     - Add PolicyRegistry for storing and retrieving policies.
     - Add interfaces by policy type and execution type.
     - Change .NetStandard minimum support to NetStandard1.1.

     5.1.0
     ---------------------
     - Allow different parts of a policy execution to exchange data via a mutable Context travelling with each execution.

     5.0.6
     ---------------------
     - Update NETStandard.Library dependency to latest 1.6.1 for .NetStandard1.0 target.  Resolves compatibility for some Xamarin targets.

     5.0.5
     ---------------------
     - Bug fix: Prevent request stampede during half-open state of CircuitBreaker and AdvancedCircuitBreaker.  Enforce only one new trial call per break duration, during half-open state.
     - Bug fix: Prevent duplicate raising of the onBreak delegate, if executions started when a circuit was closed, return faults when a circuit has already opened.
     - Optimisation: Optimise hotpaths for Circuit-Breaker, Retry and Fallback policies.
     - Add NoOpPolicy: NoOpPolicy executes delegates without intervention; for eg stubbing out Polly in unit testing.

     5.0.4 pre
     ---------------------
     - (.NET40Async package changes only)

     5.0.3 RTM
     ---------------------
     - Refine implementation of cancellable synchronous WaitAndRetry
     - Minor breaking change: Where a user delegate does not observe cancellation, Polly will now honour the delegate's outcome rather than throw for the unobserved cancellation (issue 188).

     5.0.2 alpha
     ---------------------
     - .NETStandard1.0 target: Correctly state dependencies. 
     - .NETStandard1.0 target: Fix SemVer stamping of Polly.dll.
     - PCL259 project and target: Remove, in favour of .NETStandard1.0 target.  PCL259 targets are still supported, via .NETStandard1.0 target.
     - Mark Polly.dll as CLSCompliant.
     
     5.0.1 alpha
     ---------------------
     - Add a .NETStandard1.0 target.

     5.0.0 alpha
     ---------------------
     A major release, adding significant new resilience policies:
     - Timeout policy: allows timing out any execution
     - Bulkhead isolation policy: limits the resources consumable by governed actions, such that a faulting channel cannot cause cascading failures.
     - Fallback policy: provides for a fallback execution or value, in case of overall failure
     - PolicyWrap: allows flexibly combining Policy instances of any type, to form an overall resilience strategy.

     Other changes include:
     - Add PolicyKeys and context to all policy executions, for logging and to support later introduction of policy events and metrics. 
     - Add CancellationToken support to synchronous executions.
     - Add some missing ExecuteAndCapture/Async overloads. 
     - Remove invalid ExecuteAsync overloads taking (but not making use of) a CancellationToken
     - Provide .NET4.0 support uniquely through Polly.NET40Async package
     - Retire ContextualPolicy (not part of documented API; support now in Policy base class)
     - Discontinue .NET3.5 support
