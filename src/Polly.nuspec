    <releaseNotes>
     v5.0 is a major release with significant new resilience policies: Timeout; Bulkhead Isolation; Fallback; Cache; and PolicyWrap.  See release notes back to v5.0.0 for full details.

     5.6.0
     ---------------------
     - Add ability to handle inner exceptions natively: .HandleInner&lt;TEx&gt;()
     - Allow WaitAndRetry policies to calculate wait based on the handled fault
     - Add the ability to access the policies within an IPolicyWrap
     - Allow PolicyWrap to take interfaces as parameters
     - Bug fix: set context keys for generic execute method with PolicyWrap
     - Bug fix: generic TResult method with non-generic fallback policy
     - Performance improvements

     5.5.0
     ---------------------
     - Bug fix: non-generic CachePolicy with PolicyWrap
     - Add Cache interfaces
     
     5.4.0
     ---------------------
     - Add CachePolicy: cache-aside pattern, with interfaces for pluggable cache providers and serializers.
     - Bug fix: Sync TimeoutPolicy in pessimistic mode no longer interposes AggregateException.
     - Provide public factory methods for PolicyResult, to support testing.
     - Fallback delegates can now take handled fault as input parameter.

     5.3.1
     ---------------------
     - Make ISyncPolicy&lt;TResult&gt; public
     - (Upgrade solution to msbuild15)

     5.3.0
     ---------------------
     - Fix ExecuteAndCapture() usage with PolicyWrap   
     - Allow Fallback delegates to take execution Context
     - Provide IReadOnlyPolicyRegistry interface

     5.2.0
     ---------------------
     - Add PolicyRegistry for storing and retrieving policies.
     - Add interfaces by policy type and execution type.
     - Change .NetStandard minimum support to NetStandard1.1.

     5.1.0
     ---------------------
     - Allow different parts of a policy execution to exchange data via a mutable Context travelling with each execution.

     5.0.6
     ---------------------
     - Update NETStandard.Library dependency to latest 1.6.1 for .NetStandard1.0 target.  Resolves compatibility for some Xamarin targets.

     5.0.5
     ---------------------
     - Bug fix: Prevent request stampede during half-open state of CircuitBreaker and AdvancedCircuitBreaker.  Enforce only one new trial call per break duration, during half-open state.
     - Bug fix: Prevent duplicate raising of the onBreak delegate, if executions started when a circuit was closed, return faults when a circuit has already opened.
     - Optimisation: Optimise hotpaths for Circuit-Breaker, Retry and Fallback policies.
     - Add NoOpPolicy: NoOpPolicy executes delegates without intervention; for eg stubbing out Polly in unit testing.

     5.0.4 pre
     ---------------------
     - (.NET40Async package changes only)

     5.0.3 RTM
     ---------------------
     - Refine implementation of cancellable synchronous WaitAndRetry
     - Minor breaking change: Where a user delegate does not observe cancellation, Polly will now honour the delegate's outcome rather than throw for the unobserved cancellation (issue 188).

     5.0.2 alpha
     ---------------------
     - .NETStandard1.0 target: Correctly state dependencies. 
     - .NETStandard1.0 target: Fix SemVer stamping of Polly.dll.
     - PCL259 project and target: Remove, in favour of .NETStandard1.0 target.  PCL259 targets are still supported, via .NETStandard1.0 target.
     - Mark Polly.dll as CLSCompliant.
     
     5.0.1 alpha
     ---------------------
     - Add a .NETStandard1.0 target.

     5.0.0 alpha
     ---------------------
     A major release, adding significant new resilience policies:
     - Timeout policy: allows timing out any execution
     - Bulkhead isolation policy: limits the resources consumable by governed actions, such that a faulting channel cannot cause cascading failures.
     - Fallback policy: provides for a fallback execution or value, in case of overall failure
     - PolicyWrap: allows flexibly combining Policy instances of any type, to form an overall resilience strategy.

     Other changes include:
     - Add PolicyKeys and context to all policy executions, for logging and to support later introduction of policy events and metrics. 
     - Add CancellationToken support to synchronous executions.
     - Add some missing ExecuteAndCapture/Async overloads. 
     - Remove invalid ExecuteAsync overloads taking (but not making use of) a CancellationToken
     - Provide .NET4.0 support uniquely through Polly.NET40Async package
     - Retire ContextualPolicy (not part of documented API; support now in Policy base class)
     - Discontinue .NET3.5 support
