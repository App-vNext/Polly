     Polly.Net40Async is a version of the Polly library for .NET 4.0 with async support via Microsoft.Bcl.Async.  Polly allows developers to express resilience policies such as Retry, Circuit Breaker, Timeout, Bulkhead Isolation, and Fallback in a fluent and thread-safe manner.

    <releaseNotes>
     v5.0 is a major release with significant new resilience policies: Timeout; Bulkhead Isolation; Fallback; Cache; and PolicyWrap.  See release notes back to v5.0.0 for full details.

     5.6.0
     ---------------------
     - Add ability to handle inner exceptions natively: .HandleInner&lt;TEx&gt;()
     - Allow WaitAndRetry policies to calculate wait based on the handled fault
     - Add the ability to access the policies within an IPolicyWrap
     - Allow PolicyWrap to take interfaces as parameters
     - Bug fix: set context keys for generic execute method with PolicyWrap
     - Bug fix: generic TResult method with non-generic fallback policy
     - Performance improvements

     5.5.0
     ---------------------
     - Bug fix: non-generic CachePolicy with PolicyWrap
     - Add Cache interfaces

     5.4.0
     ---------------------
     - Add CachePolicy: cache-aside pattern, with interfaces for pluggable cache providers and serializers.
     - Bug fix: Sync TimeoutPolicy in pessimistic mode no longer interposes AggregateException.
     - Provide public factory methods for PolicyResult, to support testing.
     - Fallback delegates can now take handled fault as input parameter.

     5.3.1
     ---------------------
     - Make ISyncPolicy&lt;TResult&gt; public
     - (Upgrade solution to msbuild15)
     
     5.3.0
     ---------------------
     - Fix ExecuteAndCapture() usage with PolicyWrap   
     - Allow Fallback delegates to take execution Context
     - Provide IReadOnlyPolicyRegistry interface

     5.2.0
     ---------------------
     - Add PolicyRegistry for storing and retrieving policies.
     - Add interfaces by policy type and execution type.
     - Change .NetStandard minimum support to NetStandard1.1.

     5.1.0
     ---------------------
     - Allow different parts of a policy execution to exchange data via a mutable Context travelling with each execution.

     5.0.6
     ---------------------
     - (.NETStandard1.0 changes only.)

     5.0.5
     ---------------------
     - Bug fix: Prevent request stampede during half-open state of CircuitBreaker and AdvancedCircuitBreaker.  Enforce only one new trial call per break duration, during half-open state.
     - Bug fix: Prevent duplicate raising of the onBreak delegate, if executions started when a circuit was closed, return faults when a circuit has already opened.
     - Optimisation: Optimise hotpaths for Circuit-Breaker, Retry and Fallback policies.
     - Add NoOpPolicy: NoOpPolicy executes delegates without intervention; for eg stubbing out Polly in unit testing.

     5.0.4 pre
     ---------------------
     - Fix Microsoft.Bcl and Nito.AsyncEx dependencies for Polly.Net40Async. 

     5.0.3 RTM
     ---------------------
     - Refine implementation of cancellable synchronous WaitAndRetry
     - Minor breaking change: Where a user delegate does not observe cancellation, Polly will now honour the delegate's outcome rather than throw for the unobserved cancellation (issue 188).

     5.0.2 alpha
     ---------------------
     - Add full specs support for .NET40. 
     - Fix issue 179: Make Net4.0 async implementation for Bulkhead truly async.

     5.0.1 alpha
     ---------------------
     - (Add a .NETStandard1.0 target.)

     5.0.0 alpha
     ---------------------
     A major release, adding significant new resilience policies:
     - Timeout policy: allows timing out any execution
     - Bulkhead isolation policy: limits the resources consumable by governed actions, such that a faulting channel cannot cause cascading failures.
     - Fallback policy: provides for a fallback execution or value, in case of overall failure
     - PolicyWrap: allows flexibly combining Policy instances of any type, to form an overall resilience strategy.

     Other changes include:
     - Add PolicyKeys and context to all policy executions, for logging and to support later introduction of policy events and metrics. 
     - Add CancellationToken support to synchronous executions.
     - Add some missing ExecuteAndCapture/Async overloads. 
     - Remove invalid ExecuteAsync overloads taking (but not making use of) a CancellationToken
     - Provide .NET4.0 support uniquely through Polly.NET40Async package
     - Retire ContextualPolicy (not part of documented API; support now in Policy base class)
     - Discontinue .NET3.5 support

      4.3.0
      ---------------------
      - Added ability for policies to handle return results.  Optimised circuit-breaker hot path.  Fixed circuit-breaker threshold bug.  

      4.2.4
      ---------------------
      - Added overloads to WaitAndRetry and WaitAndRetryAsync methods that accept an onRetry delegate which includes the attempt count.

      4.2.3
      ---------------------
      - Cleaned up new Polly.Net40Async NuGet package, removing Polly.dll and unused framework folders.

      4.2.2
      ---------------------
      - Add new Polly.Net40Async project supporting async for .NET40 via Microsoft.Bcl.Async.  This is available as separate Nuget packages Polly.Net40Async and Polly.Net40Async-signed.
