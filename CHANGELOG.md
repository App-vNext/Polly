A major release, adding significant new resilience policies:

- Fallback policy: provides for a fallback execution or value, in case of overall failure. Thanks to [@reisenberger](https://github.com/reisenberger)
- PolicyWrap: allows flexibly combining Policy instances of any type, to form an overall resilience strategy. Thanks to [@reisenberger](https://github.com/reisenberger)

Other changes include:

- Add PolicyKeys and context to all policy executions, for logging and to support later introduction of policy events and metrics. Thanks to [@reisenberger](https://github.com/reisenberger)
