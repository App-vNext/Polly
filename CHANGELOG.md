- Add manual control of circuit-breaker (reset and manual circuit isolation)
- Add public reporting of circuit-breaker state, for health/performance monitoring
- Add delegates on changes of circuit state
- Thanks to [@reisenberger](https://github.com/reisenberger)


## 3.0.0

- Add cancellation support for all async Policy execution - Thanks to [@reisenberger](https://github.com/reisenberger)


## 2.2.7

- Fixes an issue where continueOnCapturedContext needed to be specified in two places (on action execution and Policy configuration), when wanting to flow async action execution on the captured context - Thanks to [@reisenberger](https://github.com/reisenberger)
- Fixes excess line ending issues

## 2.2.6

- Async sleep fix, plus added continueOnCapturedContext parameter on async methods to control whether continuation and retry will run on captured synchronization context - Thanks to [@yevhen](https://github.com/yevhen)

## 2.2.5

- Policies with a retry count of zero are now allowed - Thanks to [@nelsonghezzi](https://github.com/nelsonghezzi)

## 2.2.4

- Add .NET Core support

## 2.2.3

- Fix PCL implementation of `SystemClock.Reset`
- Added ability to capture the results of executing a policy via `ExecuteAndCapture` - Thanks to [@ThomasMentzel](https://github.com/ThomasMentzel)
