## 5.0.0 alpha

A major release, adding significant new resilience policies:

- Timeout policy: allows timing out any execution. Thanks to [@reisenberger](https://github.com/reisenberger).
- Bulkhead isolation policy: limits the resources consumable by governed actions, such that a faulting channel cannot cause cascading failures. Thanks to [@reisenberger](https://github.com/reisenberger) and contributions from [@brunolauze](https://github.com/brunolauze).
- Fallback policy: provides for a fallback execution or value, in case of overall failure. Thanks to [@reisenberger](https://github.com/reisenberger)
- PolicyWrap: allows flexibly combining Policy instances of any type, to form an overall resilience strategy. Thanks to [@reisenberger](https://github.com/reisenberger)

Other changes include:

- Add PolicyKeys and context to all policy executions, for logging and to support later introduction of policy events and metrics. Thanks to [@reisenberger](https://github.com/reisenberger)
- Add CancellationToken support to synchronous executions.  Thanks to [@brunolauze](https://github.com/brunolauze) and [@reisenberger](https://github.com/reisenberger)
- Add some missing ExecuteAndCapture/Async overloads. Thanks to [@reisenberger](https://github.com/reisenberger)
- Remove invalid ExecuteAsync overloads taking (but not making use of) a CancellationToken
