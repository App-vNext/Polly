about: You have something specific to achieve and the existing documentation hasn't
  covered how.

<!-- 
Be sure to check out the ReadMe (https://github.com/App-vNext/Polly/blob/master/README.md) and wiki (https://github.com/App-vNext/Polly/wiki) first!  

https://github.com/App-vNext/Polly/wiki contains detailed pages on each policy type. Many questions are answered there about policy operation, how to change operation with configuration options, and how to attach behaviour via delegates.  Other wiki pages cover [unit-testing](https://github.com/App-vNext/Polly/wiki/Unit-testing-with-Polly), [async usage](https://github.com/App-vNext/Polly/wiki/Asynchronous-action-execution), common patterns, and [using HttpClientFactory in ASPNET Core2.1 as the best way to integrate Polly into outbound `HttpClient` calls](https://github.com/App-vNext/Polly/wiki/Polly-and-HttpClientFactory).

**Summary: What are you wanting to achieve?**

**What code or approach do you have so far?**  

<br/>
<br/>

It is _always_ useful to see:

+ **code of any policy declarations**, 
+ **code of the calls to `.Execute/AndCapture/Async(...)`**
