## Podcasts

- June 2018: [DotNetRocks features Polly](https://www.dotnetrocks.com/?show=1556) as [Carl Franklin](https://twitter.com/carlfranklin) and [Richard Campbell](https://twitter.com/richcampbell) chat with [Dylan Reisenberger](https://twitter.com/softwarereisen) about policy patterns, and the new ASP NET Core 2.1 integration with `IHttpClientFactory`.
- April 2017: [Dylan Reisenberger](https://twitter.com/softwarereisen) sits down virtually with [Bryan Hogan](https://twitter.com/bryanjhogan) of [No Dogma Blog](http://nodogmablog.bryanhogan.net/) for an [Introduction to Polly podcast](http://nodogmapodcast.bryanhogan.net/71-dylan-reisenberger-the-polly-project/).  Why do I need Polly?  History of the Polly project.  What do we mean by resilience and transient faults?  How retry and circuit-breaker help.  Exponential back-off.  Stability patterns.  Bulkhead isolation.  Future directions (as at April 2017).

## PluralSight course

- [Bryan Hogan](https://twitter.com/bryanjhogan) of the [No Dogma Blog](http://nodogmablog.bryanhogan.net/) has authored a [PluralSight course on Polly](https://www.pluralsight.com/courses/polly-fault-tolerant-web-service-requests).  The course takes you through all the major features of Polly, with an additional module added in the fall of 2018 on Http Client Factory.  The course examples are based around using Polly for fault tolerance when calling remote web services, but the principles and techniques are applicable to any context in which Polly may be used.

## Sample micro-services architecture and e-book

### Sample micro-services architecture

- [Cesar de la Torre](https://github.com/CESARDELATORRE) produced the Microsoft [eShopOnContainers project](https://github.com/dotnet-architecture/eShopOnContainers), a sample project demonstrating a .NET Micro-services architecture. The project uses Polly retry and circuit-breaker policies for resilience in calls to micro-services, and in establishing connections to transports such as RabbitMQ.

### e-book

- Accompanying the project is a [.NET Micro-services Architecture e-book](https://www.microsoft.com/net/download/thank-you/microservices-architecture-ebook) with an extensive section (section 8) on using Polly for resilience, to which [Dylan Reisenberger](https://twitter.com/softwarereisen) contributed.  The e-book and code is now (June 2018) updated for using the latest ASP NET Core 2.1 features, [Polly with `IHttpClientFactory`](https://github.com/App-vNext/Polly/wiki/Polly-and-HttpClientFactory).

## Videos

- [Robust Applications with Polly, the .NET Resilience Framework](https://www.infoq.com/presentations/polly), Bryan Hogan introduces Polly and explains how to use it to build a fault tolerant application.
- From MVP [Houssem Dellai](https://github.com/HoussemDellai), a [YouTube video on How to use Polly with Xamarin Apps](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7vsN0RkFN_E), covering wait-and-retry and discussing circuit-breaker policy with a demonstration in Xamarin Forms.  Here is the [source code](https://github.com/HoussemDellai/ResilientHttpClient) of the application demonstrated in the video.  Draws on the [`ResilientHttpClient`](https://github.com/dotnet-architecture/eShopOnContainers/blob/dev/src/BuildingBlocks/Resilience/Resilience.Http/ResilientHttpClient.cs) from Microsoft's [eShopOnContainers project](https://github.com/dotnet-architecture/eShopOnContainers).
- In the video, [.NET Rocks Live with Jon Skeet and Bill Wagner](https://youtu.be/LCj7h7ZoHA8?t=1617), Bill Wagner discusses Polly.
- Scott Allen discusses Polly during his [Building for Resiliency and Scale in the Cloud](https://youtu.be/SFLu6jZWXGs?t=1440) presentation at NDC.
- [ASP.NET Community Stand-up April 24, 2018](https://youtu.be/k0Xy-5zE9to?t=12m22s): Damian Edwards, Jon Galloway and Scott Hanselman discuss Scott Hanselman's blog on [Polly with `IHttpClientFactory`](https://www.hanselman.com/blog/AddingResilienceAndTransientFaultHandlingToYourNETCoreHttpClientWithPolly.aspx) and the [Polly team documentation on `IHttpClientFactory`](https://github.com/App-vNext/Polly/wiki/Polly-and-HttpClientFactory). Interesting background discussion also on feature richness and the importance of good documentation.
