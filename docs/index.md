# Polly Documentation

Polly is a .NET resilience and transient-fault-handling library that allows developers to express resilience strategies such as Retry, Circuit Breaker, Hedging, Timeout, Rate Limiter and Fallback in a fluent and thread-safe manner.

We are a member of the [.NET Foundation](https://www.dotnetfoundation.org/about)!

## What can Polly do for you?

Polly lets you express different resilience strategies to cope with various scenarios, such as:

- [Retry](strategies/retry.md): Automatically retry failed requests after a short delay. Useful for transient errors that may self-correct.
- [Circuit Breaker](strategies/circuit-breaker.md): Fail fast and stop making requests when a system is overloaded or unhealthy. Useful for protecting a system from further damage and giving it time to recover.
- [Timeout](strategies/timeout.md): Set a maximum time limit for a request and abort it if it takes too long. Useful for avoiding indefinite waits and freeing up resources.
- [Rate Limiter](strategies/rate-limiter.md): Control the rate of requests to a system and reject or queue them if they exceed the limit. Useful for managing load and preventing throttling or overloading.
- [Fallback](strategies/fallback.md): Provide an alternative response or action in case of failure. Useful for degrading gracefully and maintaining user experience.
- [Hedging](strategies/hedging.md): Execute parallel requests when a system is slow and take the fastest one. Useful for reducing latency and improving responsiveness.

You can learn more about each strategy and how to configure it in the [resilience strategies](strategies/index.md) section.

## Getting started

Polly is easy to install and use. You can follow the [getting started](getting-started.md) guide to set up Polly in your project and start applying resilience strategies in your projects.
