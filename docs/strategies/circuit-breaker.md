# Circuit breaker resilience strategy

## About

- **Options**:
  - [`CircuitBreakerStrategyOptions`](xref:Polly.CircuitBreaker.CircuitBreakerStrategyOptions)
  - [`CircuitBreakerStrategyOptions<T>`](xref:Polly.CircuitBreaker.CircuitBreakerStrategyOptions)
- **Extensions**: `AddCircuitBreaker`
- **Strategy Type**: Reactive
- **Exceptions**:
  - `BrokenCircuitException`: Thrown when a circuit is broken and the action could not be executed.
  - `IsolatedCircuitException`: Thrown when a circuit is isolated (held open) by manual override.

---

> [!NOTE]
> Be aware that the Circuit Breaker strategy [rethrows all exceptions](https://github.com/App-vNext/Polly/wiki/Circuit-Breaker#exception-handling), including those that are handled. A Circuit Breaker's role is to monitor faults and break the circuit when a certain threshold is reached; it does not manage retries. Combine the Circuit Breaker with a Retry strategy if needed.

## Usage

<!-- snippet: circuit-breaker -->
```cs
// Circuit breaker with default options.
// See https://www.pollydocs.org/strategies/circuit-breaker#defaults for defaults.
var optionsDefaults = new CircuitBreakerStrategyOptions();

// Circuit breaker with customized options:
// The circuit will break if more than 50% of actions result in handled exceptions,
// within any 10-second sampling duration, and at least 8 actions are processed.
var optionsComplex = new CircuitBreakerStrategyOptions
{
    FailureRatio = 0.5,
    SamplingDuration = TimeSpan.FromSeconds(10),
    MinimumThroughput = 8,
    BreakDuration = TimeSpan.FromSeconds(30),
    ShouldHandle = new PredicateBuilder().Handle<SomeExceptionType>()
};

// Circuit breaker using BreakDurationGenerator:
// The break duration is dynamically determined based on the properties of BreakDurationGeneratorArguments.
var optionsBreakDurationGenerator = new CircuitBreakerStrategyOptions
{
    FailureRatio = 0.5,
    SamplingDuration = TimeSpan.FromSeconds(10),
    MinimumThroughput = 8,
    BreakDurationGenerator = static args => new ValueTask<TimeSpan>(TimeSpan.FromMinutes(args.FailureCount)),
};

// Handle specific failed results for HttpResponseMessage:
var optionsShouldHandle = new CircuitBreakerStrategyOptions<HttpResponseMessage>
{
    ShouldHandle = new PredicateBuilder<HttpResponseMessage>()
        .Handle<SomeExceptionType>()
        .HandleResult(response => response.StatusCode == HttpStatusCode.InternalServerError)
};

// Monitor the circuit state, useful for health reporting:
var stateProvider = new CircuitBreakerStateProvider();
var optionsStateProvider = new CircuitBreakerStrategyOptions<HttpResponseMessage>
{
    StateProvider = stateProvider
};

var circuitState = stateProvider.CircuitState;

/*
CircuitState.Closed - Normal operation; actions are executed.
CircuitState.Open - Circuit is open; actions are blocked.
CircuitState.HalfOpen - Recovery state after break duration expires; actions are permitted.
CircuitState.Isolated - Circuit is manually held open; actions are blocked.
*/

// Manually control the Circuit Breaker state:
var manualControl = new CircuitBreakerManualControl();
var optionsManualControl = new CircuitBreakerStrategyOptions
{
    ManualControl = manualControl
};

// Manually isolate a circuit, e.g., to isolate a downstream service.
await manualControl.IsolateAsync();

// Manually close the circuit to allow actions to be executed again.
await manualControl.CloseAsync();

// Add a circuit breaker strategy with a CircuitBreakerStrategyOptions{<TResult>} instance to the pipeline
new ResiliencePipelineBuilder().AddCircuitBreaker(optionsDefaults);
new ResiliencePipelineBuilder<HttpResponseMessage>().AddCircuitBreaker(optionsStateProvider);
```

## Diagrams

### State diagram

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
direction LR
    [*] --> Closed
    Closed --> Open: Exceeds threshold
    Open --> HalfOpen: Elapses break duration
    HalfOpen --> Closed: Passes the probe
    HalfOpen --> Open: Fails the probe
```

Whenever someone says _the circuit breaks_ that means the Circuit Breaker transitions from the `Closed` state to the `Open` state.

### Simple

Let's suppose we have a circuit breaker strategy wit the following configuration:

- `SamplingDuration`: `2 seconds`;
- `MinimumThroughput`: `2`;
- `FailureRatio` : `0.5`.

#### Simple: happy path sequence diagram

The circuit will not break because the actual failure ratio (0.33) will be below the threshold (0.5) after the 3rd call.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    autonumber
    actor C as Caller
    participant P as Pipeline
    participant CB as CircuitBreaker
    participant D as DecoratedUserCallback

    C->>P: Calls ExecuteAsync
    P->>CB: Calls ExecuteCore
    Note over CB: Closed state
    Note over CB, D: Sampling start
    activate CB
    CB->>+D: Invokes
    D->>-CB: Returns result
    CB->>P: Returns result
    P->>C: Returns result

    C->>P: Calls ExecuteAsync
    P->>CB: Calls ExecuteCore
    CB->>+D: Invokes
    D->>-CB: Returns result
    CB->>P: Returns result
    P->>C: Returns result

    C->>P: Calls ExecuteAsync
    P->>CB: Calls ExecuteCore
    CB->>+D: Invokes
    D->>-CB: Fails
    deactivate CB
    Note over CB, D: Sampling end
    CB->>P: Propagates failure
    P->>C: Propagates failure
```

#### Simple: unhappy path sequence diagram

The circuit will break because the actual failure ratio meets the threshold (0.5) after the 2nd call.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    autonumber
    actor C as Caller
    participant P as Pipeline
    participant CB as CircuitBreaker
    participant D as DecoratedUserCallback

    C->>P: Calls ExecuteAsync
    P->>CB: Calls ExecuteCore
    Note over CB: Closed state
    Note over CB, D: Sampling start
    activate CB
    CB->>+D: Invokes
    D->>-CB: Returns result
    CB->>P: Returns result
    P->>C: Returns result

    C->>P: Calls ExecuteAsync
    P->>CB: Calls ExecuteCore
    CB->>+D: Invokes
    D->>-CB: Fails
    Note over CB: Moves to Open state
    CB->>P: Propagates failure
    P->>C: Propagates failure

    C->>P: Calls ExecuteAsync
    P->>CB: Calls ExecuteCore
    CB-->>CB: Rejects request
    CB->>P: Throws <br/>BrokenCircuitException
    P->>C: Propagates exception
    deactivate CB
    Note over CB, D: Sampling end
```

### Complex

Let's suppose we have a circuit breaker strategy with the following configuration:

- `SamplingDuration`: `2 seconds`;
- `MinimumThroughput`: `2`;
- `FailureRatio`: `0.5`;
- `BreakDuration`:`1 second`.

#### Complex: happy path sequence diagram

The circuit will break and later it will transition into the `HalfOpen` state. The probe will then succeed, so the circuit breaker will go back to the normal (`Closed`) state.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    autonumber
    actor C as Caller
    participant P as Pipeline
    participant CB as CircuitBreaker
    participant D as DecoratedUserCallback

    C->>P: Calls ExecuteAsync
    P->>CB: Calls ExecuteCore
    Note over CB: Closed state
    CB->>+D: Invokes
    D->>-CB: Fails
    CB->>P: Propagates failure
    P->>C: Propagates failure

    C->>P: Calls ExecuteAsync
    P->>CB: Calls ExecuteCore
    CB->>+D: Invokes
    D->>-CB: Fails
    Note over CB: Moves to Open state
    Note over CB: Break duration start
    CB->>P: Propagates failure
    P->>C: Propagates failure

    C->>P: Calls ExecuteAsync
    P->>CB: Calls ExecuteCore
    CB-->>CB: Rejects request
    CB->>P: Throws <br/>BrokenCircuitException
    P->>C: Propagates exception

    C->>P: Calls ExecuteAsync
    P->>CB: Calls ExecuteCore
    Note over CB: Break duration end
    Note over CB: Moves to HalfOpen state
    CB->>+D: Invokes
    D->>-CB: Returns result
    Note over CB: Moves to Closed state
    CB->>P: Returns result
    P->>C: Returns result
```

#### Complex: unhappy path sequence diagram

The circuit will break and later it will transition into the `HalfOpen` state. The probe will then fail, so the circuit breaker will become broken again (the `Open` state).

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    autonumber
    actor C as Caller
    participant P as Pipeline
    participant CB as CircuitBreaker
    participant D as DecoratedUserCallback

    C->>P: Calls ExecuteAsync
    P->>CB: Calls ExecuteCore
    Note over CB: Closed state
    CB->>+D: Invokes
    D->>-CB: Fails
    CB->>P: Propagates failure
    P->>C: Propagates failure

    C->>P: Calls ExecuteAsync
    P->>CB: Calls ExecuteCore
    CB->>+D: Invokes
    D->>-CB: Fails
    Note over CB: Moves to Open state
    Note over CB: Break duration start
    CB->>P: Propagates failure
    P->>C: Propagates failure

    C->>P: Calls ExecuteAsync
    P->>CB: Calls ExecuteCore
    CB-->>CB: Rejects request
    CB->>P: Throws <br/>BrokenCircuitException
    P->>C: Propagates exception

    C->>P: Calls ExecuteAsync
    P->>CB: Calls ExecuteCore
    Note over CB: Break duration end
    Note over CB: Moves to HalfOpen state
    CB->>+D: Invokes
    D->>-CB: Fails
    Note over CB: Moves to Open state
    CB->>P: Propagates failure
    P->>C: Propagates failure
```

## Anti-patterns

Over the years, many developers have used Polly in various ways. Some of these
recurring patterns may not be ideal. The sections below highlight anti-patterns to avoid.

### Using different sleep duration between retry attempts based on Circuit Breaker state

Imagine that we have an inner Circuit Breaker and an outer Retry strategies.

We would like to define the retry in a way that the sleep duration calculation is taking into account the Circuit Breaker's state.

❌ DON'T

Use a closure to branch based on circuit breaker state:

<!-- snippet: circuit-breaker-anti-pattern-circuit-aware-retry -->
```cs
var stateProvider = new CircuitBreakerStateProvider();
var circuitBreaker = new ResiliencePipelineBuilder()
    .AddCircuitBreaker(new()
    {
        ShouldHandle = new PredicateBuilder().Handle<HttpRequestException>(),
        BreakDuration = TimeSpan.FromSeconds(5),
        StateProvider = stateProvider
    })
    .Build();

var retry = new ResiliencePipelineBuilder()
    .AddRetry(new()
    {
        ShouldHandle = new PredicateBuilder()
            .Handle<HttpRequestException>()
            .Handle<BrokenCircuitException>(),
        DelayGenerator = args =>
        {
            TimeSpan? delay = TimeSpan.FromSeconds(1);
            if (stateProvider.CircuitState == CircuitState.Open)
            {
                delay = TimeSpan.FromSeconds(5);
            }

            return ValueTask.FromResult(delay);
        }
    })
    .Build();
```
<!-- endSnippet -->

**Reasoning**:

- By default, each strategy is independent and has no any reference to other strategies.
- We use the (`stateProvider`) to access the Circuit Breaker's state. However, this approach is not optimal as the retry strategy's `DelayGenerator` varies based on state.
- This solution is delicate because the break duration and the sleep duration aren't linked.
- If a future code maintainer modifies the `circuitBreaker`'s `BreakDuration`, they might overlook adjusting the sleep duration.

✅ DO

Use `Context` to pass information between strategies:

<!-- snippet: circuit-breaker-pattern-circuit-aware-retry -->
```cs
var circuitBreaker = new ResiliencePipelineBuilder()
    .AddCircuitBreaker(new()
    {
        ShouldHandle = new PredicateBuilder().Handle<HttpRequestException>(),
        BreakDuration = TimeSpan.FromSeconds(5),
        OnOpened = static args =>
        {
            args.Context.Properties.Set(SleepDurationKey, args.BreakDuration);
            return ValueTask.CompletedTask;
        },
        OnClosed = args =>
        {
            args.Context.Properties.Set(SleepDurationKey, null);
            return ValueTask.CompletedTask;
        }
    })
    .Build();

var retry = new ResiliencePipelineBuilder()
    .AddRetry(new()
    {
        ShouldHandle = new PredicateBuilder()
            .Handle<HttpRequestException>()
            .Handle<BrokenCircuitException>(),
        DelayGenerator = static args =>
        {
            _ = args.Context.Properties.TryGetValue(SleepDurationKey, out var delay);
            delay ??= TimeSpan.FromSeconds(1);
            return ValueTask.FromResult(delay);
        }
    })
    .Build();
```
<!-- endSnippet -->

**Reasoning**:

- Both strategies are less coupled in this approach since they rely on the context and the `sleepDurationKey` components.
- The Circuit Breaker shares the `BreakDuration` through the context when it breaks. When it transitions back to Closed, the sharing is revoked.
- The Retry strategy fetches the sleep duration dynamically without knowing any specific knowledge about the Circuit Breaker.
- If adjustments are needed for the `BreakDuration`, they can be made in one place.

### Wrapping each endpoint with a circuit breaker

Imagine that you have to call N number of services via `HttpClient`s.
You want to decorate all downstream calls with the service-aware Circuit Breaker.

❌ DON'T

Use a collection of Circuit Breakers and explicitly call `ExecuteAsync()`:

<!-- snippet: circuit-breaker-anti-pattern-cb-per-endpoint -->
```cs
// Defined in a common place
var uriToCbMappings = new Dictionary<Uri, ResiliencePipeline>
{
    [new Uri("https://downstream1.com")] = GetCircuitBreaker(),
    // ...
    [new Uri("https://downstreamN.com")] = GetCircuitBreaker()
};

// Used in the downstream 1 client
var downstream1Uri = new Uri("https://downstream1.com");
await uriToCbMappings[downstream1Uri].ExecuteAsync(CallXYZOnDownstream1, CancellationToken.None);
```
<!-- endSnippet -->

**Reasoning**:

- Whenever you use an `HttpClient`, you must have a reference to the `uriToCbMappings` dictionary.
- It's your responsibility to decorate each network call with the corresponding circuit breaker.

✅ DO

Use named and typed `HttpClient`s:

```cs
foreach (string uri in uris)
{
    builder.Services
      .AddHttpClient<IResilientClient, ResilientClient>(uri, client => client.BaseAddress = new Uri(uri))
      .AddPolicyHandler(GetCircuitBreaker().AsAsyncPolicy<HttpResponseMessage>());
}

...
private const string serviceUrl = "https://downstream1.com";
public Downstream1Client(
   IHttpClientFactory namedClientFactory,
   ITypedHttpClientFactory<ResilientClient> typedClientFactory)
{
    var namedClient = namedClientFactory.CreateClient(serviceUrl);
    var namedTypedClient = typedClientFactory.CreateClient(namedClient);
    ...
}
```

**Reasoning**:

- The `HttpClient` integrates with Circuit Breaker during startup.
- There's no need to call `ExecuteAsync()` directly. The `DelegatingHandler` handles it automatically.

> [!NOTE]
> The above sample code used the `AsAsyncPolicy<HttpResponseMessage>()` method to convert the `ResiliencePipeline<HttpResponseMessage>` to `IAsyncPolicy<HttpResponseMessage>`.
> It is required because the `AddPolicyHandler()` method anticipates an `IAsyncPolicy<HttpResponse>` parameter.
> Please be aware that, later an `AddResilienceHandler()` will be introduced in the `Microsoft.Extensions.Http.Resilience` package which is the successor of the `Microsoft.Extensions.Http.Polly`.

### Reducing thrown exceptions

In case of Circuit Breaker when it is either in the `Open` or `Isolated` state new requests are rejected immediately.

That means the strategy will throw either a `BrokenCircuitException` or an `IsolatedCircuitException` respectively.

❌ DON'T

Use guard expression to call `Execute{Async}` only if the circuit is not broken:

<!-- snippet: circuit-breaker-anti-pattern-reduce-thrown-exceptions -->
```cs
var stateProvider = new CircuitBreakerStateProvider();
var circuitBreaker = new ResiliencePipelineBuilder()
    .AddCircuitBreaker(new()
    {
        ShouldHandle = new PredicateBuilder().Handle<HttpRequestException>(),
        BreakDuration = TimeSpan.FromSeconds(0.5),
        StateProvider = stateProvider
    })
    .Build();

if (stateProvider.CircuitState
    is not CircuitState.Open
    and not CircuitState.Isolated)
{
    var response = await circuitBreaker.ExecuteAsync(static async ct =>
    {
        return await IssueRequest();
    }, CancellationToken.None);

    // Your code goes here to process response
}
```
<!-- endSnippet -->

**Reasoning**:

- The problem with this approach is that the circuit breaker will never transition into the `HalfOpen` state.
- The circuit breaker does not act as an active object. In other words the state transition does not happen automatically in the background.
- The circuit transition into the `HalfOpen` state when the `Execute{Async}` method is called and the `BreakDuration` elapsed.

✅ DO

Use `ExecuteOutcomeAsync` to avoid throwing exception:

<!-- snippet: circuit-breaker-pattern-reduce-thrown-exceptions -->
```cs
var context = ResilienceContextPool.Shared.Get();
var circuitBreaker = new ResiliencePipelineBuilder()
    .AddCircuitBreaker(new()
    {
        ShouldHandle = new PredicateBuilder().Handle<HttpRequestException>(),
        BreakDuration = TimeSpan.FromSeconds(0.5),
    })
    .Build();

Outcome<HttpResponseMessage> outcome = await circuitBreaker.ExecuteOutcomeAsync(static async (ctx, state) =>
{
    var response = await IssueRequest();
    return Outcome.FromResult(response);
}, context, "state");

ResilienceContextPool.Shared.Return(context);

if (outcome.Exception is BrokenCircuitException)
{
    // The execution was stopped by the circuit breaker
}
else
{
    HttpResponseMessage response = outcome.Result!;
    // Your code goes here to process the response
}
```
<!-- endSnippet -->

**Reasoning**:

- The `ExecuteOutcomeAsync` is a low-allocation API which does not throw exceptions; rather it captures them inside an `Outcome` data structure.
- Since you are calling one of the `Execute` methods, that's why the circuit breaker can transition into the `HalfOpen` state.
