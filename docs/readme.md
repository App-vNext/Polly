# Polly Documentation

Polly is a .NET resilience and transient-fault-handling library that allows developers to express resilience strategies such as Retry, Circuit Breaker, Hedging, Timeout, Rate Limiter and Fallback in a fluent and thread-safe manner.

We are a member of the [.NET Foundation](https://www.dotnetfoundation.org/about)!

## Resilience strategies

| Strategy | Reactive | Premise | AKA | How does the strategy mitigate?|
| ------------- | --- | ------------- |:-------------: |------------- |
|[Retry](strategies/retry.md) |Yes|Many faults are transient and may self-correct after a short delay.| *Maybe it's just a blip* |  Allows configuring automatic retries. |
|[Circuit-breaker](strategies/circuit-breaker.md) |Yes|When a system is seriously struggling, failing fast is better than making users/callers wait.  <br/><br/>Protecting a faulting system from overload can help it recover. | *Stop doing it if it hurts* <br/><br/>*Give that system a break* | Breaks the circuit (blocks executions) for a period, when faults exceed some pre-configured threshold. |
|[Timeout](strategies/timeout.md)|No|Beyond a certain wait, a success result is unlikely.| *Don't wait forever*  |Guarantees the caller won't have to wait beyond the timeout. |
|[Rate Limiter](strategies/rate-limiter.md)|No|Limiting the rate a system handles requests is another way to control load. <br/><br/> This can apply to the way your system accepts incoming calls, and/or to the way you call downstream services. | *Slow down a bit, will you?*  |Constrains executions to not exceed a certain rate. |
|[Fallback](strategies/fallback.md)|Yes|Things will still fail - plan what you will do when that happens.| *Degrade gracefully*  |Defines an alternative value to be returned (or action to be executed) on failure. |
|[Hedging](strategies/hedging.md)|Yes|Things can be slow sometimes, plan what you will do when that happens.| *Hedge your bets*  | Executes parallel actions when things are slow and waits for the fastest one.  |
