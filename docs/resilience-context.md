# Resilience Context

> [!NOTE]
> This is documentation for the upcoming Polly v8 release.

The `ResilienceContext` class in Polly provides an execution-scoped instance that accompanies each execution through a Polly resilience strategy. This class serves to share context and facilitate information exchange between the pre-execution, mid-execution, and post-execution phases.

The resilience context exposes several properties:

- `OperationKey`: A user-defined identifier for the operation.
- `CancellationToken`: The cancellation token linked to the operation.
- `Properties`: An instance of `ResilienceProperties` for attaching custom data to the context.
- `ContinueOnCapturedContext`: Specifies whether the asynchronous execution should continue on the captured context.

## Usage

Below is an example demonstrating how to work with `ResilienceContext`:

<!-- snippet: resilience-context -->
```cs
// Retrieve a context with a cancellation token
ResilienceContext context = ResilienceContextPool.Shared.Get(cancellationToken);

// Attach custom data to the context

context.Properties.Set(MyResilienceKeys.Key1, "my-data");
context.Properties.Set(MyResilienceKeys.Key2, 123);

// Utilize the context in a resilience pipeline
ResiliencePipeline pipeline = new ResiliencePipelineBuilder()
    .AddRetry(new()
    {
        OnRetry = static args =>
        {
            // Retrieve custom data from the context, if available
            if (args.Context.Properties.TryGetValue(MyResilienceKeys.Key1, out var data))
            {
                Console.WriteLine("OnRetry, Custom Data: {0}", data);
            }

            return default;
        }
    })
    .Build();

// Execute the resilience pipeline asynchronously
await pipeline.ExecuteAsync(
    async context =>
    {
        // Insert your execution logic here
    },
    context);

// Return the context to the pool
ResilienceContextPool.Shared.Return(context);
```
<!-- endSnippet -->

Where `ResilienceKeys` is defined as:

<!-- snippet: resilience-keys -->
```cs
public static class MyResilienceKeys
{
    public static readonly ResiliencePropertyKey<string> Key1 = new("my-key-1");

    public static readonly ResiliencePropertyKey<int> Key2 = new("my-key-2");
}
```
<!-- endSnippet -->

## Resilient context pooling

<!-- Overview -->
The `ResilienceContext` object is resource-intensive to create, and recreating it for each execution would negatively impact performance. To address this issue, Polly provides a `ResilienceContextPool`. This pool allows you to obtain and reuse `ResilienceContext` instances. Once you've finished using a context instance, you can return it to the pool. This action will reset the context to its initial state, making it available for reuse.

<!-- Methods -->
The `ResilienceContextPool` offers several `Get` methods. These methods not only allow you to retrieve a `ResilienceContext` instance, but also enable you to initialize some of its properties at the time of retrieval.

<!-- snippet: resilience-context-pool -->
```cs
// Retrieve a context with a cancellation token
ResilienceContext context = ResilienceContextPool.Shared.Get(cancellationToken);

try
{
    // Retrieve a context with a specific operation key
    context = ResilienceContextPool.Shared.Get("my-operation-key", cancellationToken);

    // Retrieve a context with multiple properties
    context = ResilienceContextPool.Shared.Get(
        operationKey: "my-operation-key",
        continueOnCapturedContext: true,
        cancellationToken: cancellationToken);

    // Use the pool here
}
finally
{
    // Returning the context back to the pool is recommended, but not required as it reduces the allocations.
    // It is also OK to not return the context in case of exceptions, if you want to avoid try-catch blocks.
    ResilienceContextPool.Shared.Return(context);
}
```
